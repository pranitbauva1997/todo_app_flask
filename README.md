## Introduction
This is a very simple ToDo app which I made to practise my flask skills
while learning about it.

### Dependencies
This project is developed with the help of python3 and might not be
compatible with python2. I would suggest to use `virtualenv`.

To setup virtualenv use:
```
virtualenv -p python3 .env
```

To activate it, use:
```
source .env/bin/activate
```

To have a good look at dependencies, please have a look at
[requirements.txt](/requirements.txt). To install the dependencies, use
```
pip -r requirements.txt
```

### Running
To run this app, use:
```
python main.py
```

Now this will be visible at `http://127.0.0.1:5000`
